# 2019 Kincade Fire Evacuation Household Survey
Developed by Erica D. Kuligowski (RMIT University, Australia), Ruggiero Lovreglio (Massey University, New Zealand), Xilei Zhao (Civil and Coastal Engineering, University of Florida), and Daniel Nilsson (University of Canterbury, New Zealand).

The Kincade fire ignited on October 23, 2019 in Sonoma County, California, coinciding with a large-scale power shutoff brought about by high winds the day before. Beginning in the northeast area of Geyersville in Sonoma County, the fire spread for 13 days (contained on November 6, 2019) and is documented as Sonoma County’s largest fire in recorded history. While there were no fatalities, the fire burned 77,758 acres, destroyed 374 structures, damaged another 60 structures, and injured five people. Approximately 186,000 people were ordered to evacuate due to the Kincade fire over several days. Sonoma County (population just under 500,000) is divided into several evacuation zones, the majority of which were under evacuation order at some point in time during the fire event. While only a small area was evacuated on the day the fire began (Geyersville, population 874), three days later, on October 26th, 6 additional zones were evacuated, and by the following day (October 27th), a total of 10 zones (population of 186,651 people) were under evacuation order.

To better understand people’s evacuation behavior during the Kincade fire and prepare for future wildfire events, we developed and distributed an online survey of households in Sonoma County from October 22, 2020 to January 10, 2021. The survey was coded within the Qualtrics survey platform. This online outreach yielded a total of 270 completed survey responses. This survey aimed to collect household-level data on the factors identified as influential on risk perception and the evacuation decision. The survey used in this study was closely adapted from a previous study of the 2016 Chimney Tops 2 fire in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. This was done to allow for comparison across the two datasets, where applicable. The survey collected data on a number of variables, including sociodemographic factors, pre-event variables (e.g., previous experience and fire risk awareness), the types of warnings received, the types of fire cues perceived (e.g., smoke, embers, or flames), their level of risk perception (at the time of evacuation decision), and whether participants decided to stay in place or evacuate. This project was approved as exempt by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board, and no personal identifiable information was collected by the survey. Note that all participants provided informed consent before taking the survey. Here, we share the Kincade fire survey instrument in English. This survey instrument can be readily adapted by researchers to study other wildfire evacuations around the world.
